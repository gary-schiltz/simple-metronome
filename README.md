# A Simple metronome built with Javascript


Whatâ€™s up my fellow brothers and sisters, I built a simple metronome in Javascript based off of the [Google metronome](https://www.google.com/?ion=1&espv=2#q=metronome). Feel free to leave questions or provide suggestions on how to improve the code. I hope this proves fruitful for some of you. A demo of which can be found [here](https://klufkin.github.io/simple-metronome/).

### The Problem: Build a Working metronome using Javascript.

**Requirements Met:**

* The metronome should display the Beats Per Minute(BPM)
* Can adjust the BPM by moving a slider
* Be able to pause and play the metronome
* Have an audio and visual queue for the beat

### Questions, Suggestions, Recommendations?

I did my best to comment the code to help in explain what is going on, but
please let me know if you have any questions or if you would like me to go into further detail about a specific piece of the code and I'll do my best to answer it. Perhaps you see a way to improve upon my example, or see a mistake somewhere, please leave a comment so that we can all improve! :)

You can find the complete solution [here](https://github.com/klufkin/simple-metronome). It is composed of three files - index.html, metronome.css, and metronome.js.

### A Challenge

If you looked at Google's metronome, you may have noticed that some of the UI elements change color as the BPM is adjusted. My current solution does not contain this feature. So my challenge to you is to devise an algorithm and implement a function to alter the UI's colors like that of [Google's Metronome](https://www.google.com/?ion=1&espv=2#q=metronome). I encourage you to share any of the work you complete!

Thanks to [Rafael Nunez](https://github.com/rafael-nunez) for taking the time to come up with a color changing solution!

Cheers!!!
